# Welcome RIPA (Reducing Invalid Planning Applications) Project Blog

## The Project

Lambeth are leading on a project with Open Systems Lab (partnered with Camden, Lewisham, Southwark and Wycombe) and funded by the Ministry of Housing and Communities Local Governmentâ€™s (MHCLG) Local Digital Fund â€“ to develop a new digital tool to speed up the submission of planning applications. The project will explore how we might design a system that reduces the number of invalid application submissions as well as making the current system more transparent and easier to navigate.

The idea is to create a system that makes it easier and quicker for users to submit the correct information, whilst helping to avoid requesting duplicate information on multiple documents. We also want to develop a system that only asks for information that is unknown, rather than information that we already hold the answer to. So, for instance, if an applicantâ€™s postcode indicates they live in a conservation area, we donâ€™t ask for this information. The vision is to develop something that is openly available for any council to use.

The project will soon be reaching a phase where we'll be prototyping what this system could look like and we really want to get some feedback on the designs.

We want to speak to users and stakeholders, including planning support staff, planning officers and planning managers, to understand a bit more about how they work and get their feedback on the prototype as itâ€™s developed.

We also want to engage with users who will use the system and will be keen to approach users of the system including agents, resident groups who are interested in getting involved, councillors and other interested users. We are particularly interested in hearing from potential users of the service who have disabilities or impairments.

## The problem

A large part of the problem is the system is confusing and difficult to navigate for applicants and often applicants are asked for duplicate information which adds to the time it takes to complete and submit an application. As a result of this opaque and confusing system, a large percentage of the planning applications that councils receive in a year are invalid. This raises costs for all parties as well as increasing the amount of time, and frustration, it takes to get planning approval.

Reasons for invalid applications

The 10 most common reasons that applications are made invalid at Lambeth are:

* Application submitted without a CIL (Community Infrastructure Levy) Additional Information form.  
* Application forms not signed and/or dated appropriately.  
* Forms not signed or dated or incorrect certificate completed.  
* Incorrect fee or no fee at all provided.  
* Drawings not labeled clearly, correctly or at all.  
* Inaccurate or incomplete plans and information.  
* Plan, elevation and/or section drawings that do not match each other.  
* Drawings not drawn to a recognized scale.  
* No red line is drawn around the application site on the site location plan. More details of this requirement can be found in the National Planning Practice Guidance.  
* Specialist reports not included â€“ e.g. Design and Access or Heritage Statements.  

## Outcome

The hope is to design a system that reduces the number of invalid application submissions as well as making the current system more transparent and easier to navigate.

This will allow planners to spend more time planning, save money for applicants, increase customer satisfaction and make savings for the council.

## Get involved

Help us design a better system for planning application submissions - Would you be interested in taking part?

Involvement would include someone from the project arranging to either meet and/or visit you, to have a quick chat from 30 minutes to perhaps an hour, to understand how the service works for you currently and any challenges with the current systems you experience, and then showing you what we've designed so we can see what you like or don't like about it. We'll use your feedback to iterate and improve the designs.

If you're interested in getting involved please get in touch with us by email [ðŸ“§](mailto:digitalplanning@lambeth.gov.uk).

It is requested the following information is provided:

* Your name 
* Are you a resident/agent / previous or potential applicant/community group?  
* Your email address  
* Your telephone number  
* Where you would be available to meet â€“ e.g. at Lambeth Town Hall or in a local library etc.
